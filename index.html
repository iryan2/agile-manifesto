      <h1>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</h1>
      <br><br><br>

      <p>
      We are uncovering better ways of developing
      software by doing it and helping others do it.
      Through this work we have come to value:

      <section class="values">
        <p class="value">
        <span class="value--left">Individuals and interactions</span> <span class="value--right">over processes and tools</span>
        <p class="value">
        <span class="value--left">Working software</span> <span class="value--right">over comprehensive documentation</span>
        <p class="value">
        <span class="value--left">Customer collaboration</span> <span class="value--right">over contract negotiation</span>
        <p class="value">
        <span class="value--left">Responding to change</span> <span class="value--right">over following a plan</span>


        <p>
        That is, while there is value in the items on
        the right, we value the items on the left more.

        <h1>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</h1>

        <br><br>

        <i>We follow these principles:</i>

        <p>
        Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
        through early and continuous delivery
        of valuable software.
        </p>

        <p>
        Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
        development. Agile processes harness change for 
        the customer's competitive advantage.
        </p>

        <p>
        Deliver working software frequently, from a 
        couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
        preference to the shorter timescale.
        </p>

        <p>
        Business people and developers must work 
        together daily throughout the project.
        </p>

        <p>
        Build projects around motivated individuals. 
        Give them the environment and support they need, 
        and trust them to get the job done.
        </p>

        <p>
        The most efficient and effective method of 
        conveying information to and within a development 
        team is face-to-face conversation.
        </p>

        <p>
        Working software is the primary measure of progress.
        </p>

        <p>
        Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
        The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
        to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p>
        Continuous attention to technical excellence 
        and good design enhances agility.
        </p>

        <p>
        Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
        of work not done--is essential.
        </p>

        <p>
        The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
        emerge from self-organizing teams.
        </p>

        <p>
        At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
        to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
        its behavior accordingly.
        </p>
